# Seq2Seq Audio

This is a small repository on using pytorch to make many to one and many to many models to generate audio.

### Navigation around the repo

There are a few folders; ```search``` and ```notebooks```. Both contain unfinished (and untested) code. The search folder contains the code for using a metaheuristic search over the hyperparameters and is not ready to be used yet. The notebooks folder contains the notebooks that were initially hosted on google.colab.

### Notebooks
Again these notebooks were made for google colab sessions, which required frequent reinstallation of libraries in bash. Certain code boxes may need to be edited/deleted.
